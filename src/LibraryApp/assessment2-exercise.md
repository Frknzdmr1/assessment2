# Library üìö

This HikingExampleTest.exercise contains a scenario of public library (pretty common in the world of programming üòâ). In this scenario you are the developer who will implement a solution which fulfils the requirements of the end users (they have been collected as user stories by your Product Owner).

## Some general hints: üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Invest some time to create a plan! 
	- Decide which classes and methods you will be creating and what they will be responsible for. You could also create a class diagram
	- Keep a rough idea of the UI in your head (or on a piece of paper): How will it look like? What will happen, if interactions take place?
- Language decision: Will it be Java, JS or React? Don't decide that upfront! Decide after you created your plan! Which language fits best onto your demands?
- Create solutions for the things the user wants from you - sometimes you may need an add-on, but don't get lost in details which may not be relevant for the result.
- Your plan will be changing while you proceed. This is okay, but please don't forget to commit frequently
- Grade points will be spread equally between the mandatory user stories. If you work on the optional stories, you can earn bonus points ‚ú®
